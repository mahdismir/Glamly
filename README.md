# Describtion:

# The idea of developing an application focused on fashion arose from the fact that it is not such a popular field in most mobile apps. To approach this issue, we decided to utilize social media as a platform to connect people with similar fashion interests, thus promoting sharing ideas and styles. The application that was developed, Glamly, allows users to share their outfits and information about the store, brand and  price where they bought them. This social network also creates a community that is passionate about fashion, in which users can get inspiration by  looking at other user's posts and following their styles. The resulting app not only lets you connect to your friends, but also to people around you, creating a larger group of contacts.
